here are the best gains I have found for both the simulation and actual boats:

simulation:
    "rudder_p_gain": 0.1,
    "rudder_i_gain": 0,
    "rudder_d_gain": 0,
    "rudder_n_gain": 0

sailbot boat rudder:
    "rudder_p_gain": 1,
    "rudder_i_gain": 0.2,
    "rudder_d_gain": 0.3,
    "rudder_n_gain": 1
