add actual rudder and sail angles to the telemetry and not just the desired rudder and sail angles


Make the telemetry data usage better by compressing data


motorboat simulation


make it so that the telemetry server node knows what the default parameters are 

EXTREMELY HIGH PRIORITY: figure out how to handle the default parameters on the telemetry server node because right now, it only uses the sailboat default parameters
